Software developed by Jose Luis Beltran & Vicente Masip Moret in 2012. This is the university fast contest version. By now...

Gratitude:

Thanks to ChristopheVersieux for its HoloEverywhere. You were light on those Android version transitions dates and Holo aspect was a difficult goal for every Android user.

In addition I'd like to say thank you to JakeWharton for its ActionBarSherlock.Same reason: big Android audience and ActionBar were inconsistent.
